Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal which <br>can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) <br>
or positive (e.g. flow), and which can be detrimental as stated by the Yerkes-Dodson law. For some people, <br>
adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According <br>to adventurer André Malraux, in his La Condition Humaine (1933), <br>
"If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".[full citation needed] Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life <br>
is either a daring adventure or nothing." <br>
<br>
Outdoor adventurous activities are typically <br>undertaken for the purposes of recreation or <br>
excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to <br>
gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers <br>and pioneers – the British adventurer Jason Lewis, <br>
for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental <br>
constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure <br>education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning. <br>
