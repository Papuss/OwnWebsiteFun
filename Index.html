  <h2>What is love <br>
  Oh baby, don't hurt me <br>
  Don't hurt me no more <br>
  Oh, baby don't hurt me <br>
  Don't hurt me no more <br>

  What is love <br>
  Yeah <br>
  Oh, I don't know why you're not there <br>
  I give you my love, but you don't care <br>
  So what is right and what is wrong <br>
  Gimme a sign <br>
  What is love <br>
  Oh baby, don't hurt me <br>
  Don't hurt me no more <br>

  Oh baby, don't hurt me <br>
  Don't hurt me no more <br>
  Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh <br>
  Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh <br>
  Oh, I don't know, what can I do <br>
